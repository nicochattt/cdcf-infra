# cdcf-infra/auth — Zitadel + OpenFGA

Shared identity (Zitadel) and relationship-based authorization (OpenFGA) for the Catholic OS umbrella.

- **Identity:** `https://auth.catholicdigitalcommons.org`
- **Authorization:** `https://authz.catholicdigitalcommons.org`

Both run as containers on the existing cdcf-website Plesk VPS via the Plesk Docker extension. Plesk terminates TLS upstream via Let's Encrypt; containers bind to `127.0.0.1` only and are reverse-proxied by Plesk's nginx. **Both services persist to the host's native PostgreSQL** — no containerized DBs in this stack.

## Canonical VPS layout

| Path on VPS | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `/opt/cdcf-auth/` | Git clone of [`CatholicOS/cdcf-infra`](https://github.com/CatholicOS/cdcf-infra). All compose, env, and scripts live under here. |
| `/opt/cdcf-auth/auth/docker-compose.prod.yml` | The compose file. |
| `/opt/cdcf-auth/auth/.env.production` | Secrets (gitignored, mode 0600, deploy user only). |
| `/opt/cdcf-auth/auth/.env.staging` | Endpoints only, no secrets — `--target staging` is the PRODUCTION instance carrying the staging origin set. Copy from `.env.staging.example`, **not** from `.env.production`. |
| `/opt/cdcf-auth/auth/setup-*.sh` | Bootstrap + provisioning scripts. |
| `/opt/cdcf-auth/auth/backup/pg-dump.sh` | Daily backup job (host `pg_dump`, not docker exec). |
| `/opt/cdcf-auth/runtime/zitadel-data/` | Zitadel's bind-mounted data dir. PAT lands here on first boot. World-writable (scratch-image constraint). |
| `/var/www/vhosts/catholicdigitalcommons.org/auth.catholicdigitalcommons.org/` | Plesk's vhost dir for the `auth.*` subdomain — just nginx config Plesk manages. No app content. |
| `/var/www/vhosts/catholicdigitalcommons.org/authz.catholicdigitalcommons.org/` | Same, for `authz.*`. |

Plesk's Docker extension picks up `docker-compose.prod.yml` at the path above via *"Add Docker Compose Project → From a folder"* pointing at `/opt/cdcf-auth/auth/`.

## Architecture pin

- Single Zitadel instance, **one Zitadel Org per property** (`CDCF`, `LiturgicalCalendar`, `BibleGet`, `OntoKit`, `Martyrology`). No automatic cross-property SSO — intentional.
- **`zitadel-login` v2 UI service is deployed** but ONLY serves `/ui/v2/login/*` — that's the login flow the **admin console** (`/ui/console/`) redirects to. Per-property end-user login UIs are still built into each property's frontend (calling Zitadel APIs directly). The two concerns are independent: admin console login (this service) vs. end-user login (each property's own UI).
- **Login names = email addresses** (instance-wide). `UserLoginMustBeDomain=false` + `UserEmailAsUsername=true` in the default domain policy — so users log in with their email, globally unique across the instance. No `<username>@<org>.<external-domain>` legacy suffix. Machine users (e.g. `automation`, `login-client`) still use machine names since they don't have emails.
- **Shared OpenFGA**, with its own database on the host Postgres.
- **Host Postgres only** — no containerized DBs. One Postgres instance to back up, patch, monitor.
- Phase 1 consumers: LiturgicalCalendarAPI + CDCF Website (`cdcf-website` issue [#2](https://github.com/CatholicOS/cdcf-website/issues/2) — team-member bio self-edit). BibleGet and OntoKit Orgs remain pre-provisioned stubs.
- See the open-question Discussion: <https://github.com/CatholicOS/cdcf-website/discussions/98>.
- **cdcf-infra owns every OpenFGA authorization model** on the shared instance —
  `auth/models/<Store>.json`, its optional `<Store>.tuples.json`, and the
  `--create-{project}-store` shorthand. Consumer repos keep no model file; their
  local stacks obtain the model by cloning this repo and running
  `setup-openfga.sh --target local` (see `martyrology-api`'s `authz-seed`
  service for the reference implementation). `auth/models/<Store>.lock.json`
  records the model ID this repo last uploaded to that store; the script only
  ever reads it — it never writes the file itself, since on the VPS the
  provisioner runs as `ubuntu` while `auth/models/` is owned by the sync user,
  and because writing a tracked file there would dirty the checkout that CI
  pulls with `--ff-only`. When a store's latest model doesn't match its lock,
  the provisioner refuses (exit 7) and prints the lock JSON on stderr for a
  human to commit via PR, rather than uploading over an out-of-band change —
  `--force-model-upload` overrides when replacing the deployed model is the
  actual intent — and note the check runs before the file-vs-store comparison,
  so a stale lock refuses even when the model file matches what is deployed.
  The guard only applies when the lock's `store_id` matches the store being
  provisioned: a lock committed for one environment (e.g. production) is
  bypassed entirely on another (e.g. a local dev stack's own store), which
  there behaves as plain compare-and-upload. With no lock file at all, an
  identical file adopts the lock and a differing file refuses. A failed
  OpenFGA request aborts the run (exit 9) — it is never read as "store absent"
  or "no model yet".

## Prerequisites

### 1. Host Postgres ≥ 14

Zitadel requires PostgreSQL 14 or newer. Check on the VPS:

```bash
psql --version
```

If older, upgrade the host Postgres (or fall back to a containerized DB in the compose) before bring-up.

### 2. Create roles + databases on the host

Run these as the Postgres superuser (typically `postgres`) on the VPS, **substituting strong passwords matching what you'll put in `.env.production`**:

```sql
CREATE ROLE zitadel WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'CHANGEME-zitadel';
ALTER ROLE zitadel CREATEDB;   -- Zitadel's start-from-init checks for the DB
                               -- via a CREATE-style probe even when it exists.
CREATE DATABASE zitadel OWNER zitadel;

CREATE ROLE openfga WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'CHANGEME-openfga';
CREATE DATABASE openfga OWNER openfga;
```

Owner role gives the runtime user the privileges Zitadel + OpenFGA need for their own migrations. The `CREATEDB` grant on `zitadel` is required even though we pre-create the database — Zitadel's `start-from-init` command always runs a database-creation probe and fails on first boot otherwise.

### 3. Allow docker-bridge connections in `pg_hba.conf`

The compose uses `host.docker.internal` to resolve to the docker-bridge host-gateway (typically `172.17.0.1`). Add to `/etc/postgresql/<version>/main/pg_hba.conf`:

```
# Allow docker-bridge connections (cdcf-auth stack)
host  zitadel   zitadel  172.16.0.0/12  scram-sha-256
host  openfga   openfga  172.16.0.0/12  scram-sha-256
# Zitadel's start-from-init first connects to the postgres system DB
# to verify its target DB exists — it needs auth permission there too.
# (The zitadel role has no privileges in the postgres DB by default;
# this is a connect-only allow.)
host  postgres  zitadel  172.16.0.0/12  scram-sha-256
```

The `172.16.0.0/12` range covers all default Docker networks (172.16-31.x.x). Reload Postgres:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload postgresql
```

### 4. Make Postgres listen on the docker bridge

In `/etc/postgresql/<version>/main/postgresql.conf`:

```
listen_addresses = 'localhost,172.17.0.1'
```

(or just `*` if the firewall already restricts external access to Postgres). Restart Postgres after this change:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
```

## First-time bring-up

```bash
# 0. Prerequisites above are done.

# 1. Clone the repo to the canonical path
sudo git clone git@github.com:CatholicOS/cdcf-infra.git /opt/cdcf-auth

# 2. Create the Zitadel runtime data dir
sudo mkdir -p /opt/cdcf-auth/runtime/zitadel-data
# Zitadel image is scratch-based — bind mount must be world-writable
sudo chmod 0777 /opt/cdcf-auth/runtime/zitadel-data

# 3. Fill the env file
sudo cp /opt/cdcf-auth/auth/.env.production.example /opt/cdcf-auth/auth/.env.production
sudo chmod 0600 /opt/cdcf-auth/auth/.env.production
# Edit — generate ZITADEL_MASTERKEY with:
#   openssl rand -base64 32 | head -c 32
# Generate OPENFGA_PRESHARED_KEY with:
#   openssl rand -base64 48
# Set ZITADEL_DB_PASSWORD and OPENFGA_DB_PASSWORD to match what you
# CREATE ROLE'd in step 2 of Prerequisites.

# 4. Bring up the stack
cd /opt/cdcf-auth/auth
sudo docker compose --env-file .env.production -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# 5. Confirm healthy
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/debug/ready   # Zitadel → 200
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8081/healthz       # OpenFGA → 200

# 6. Two PAT files land in /opt/cdcf-auth/runtime/zitadel-data/ after first boot:
#      automation-user.pat  - IAM_OWNER, used by setup-zitadel.sh and our own admin scripts
#      login-client.pat     - IAM_LOGIN_CLIENT, consumed by the zitadel-login container
#    Run the bootstrap scripts (--all does rename-bootstrap-admin + create-orgs
#    + provision-litcal + provision-litcal-frontend
#    + provision-litcal-tests-ui + provision-cdcf-website
#    + provision-martyrology):
cd /opt/cdcf-auth/auth
./setup-zitadel.sh   --target production --all
./setup-openfga.sh   --target production --create-litcal-store
./setup-openfga.sh   --target production --create-martyrology-store
```

`setup-openfga.sh` uploads each store's model and then seeds its **structural**
tuples from `auth/models/<StoreName>.tuples.json`, if that file exists. The
`Martyrology` model is governance-body-scoped and inert without its
`edition → governed_by → governance_body` tuples, so those ship as
`auth/models/Martyrology.tuples.json` and are applied by the run above.
`LiturgicalCalendar` has no such file and is unaffected.

Seeding is idempotent (existing tuples are read first and only the difference is
written), fatal on a malformed tuples file, and **never deletes** — tuples in the
store using a managed relation but absent from the file are reported as drift and
left alone. To re-apply after editing a tuples file, without re-uploading the
model:

```bash
./setup-openfga.sh --target production --seed-tuples Martyrology
```

**Human role grants are not seeded.** Giving a person `reader`/`editor`/`admin`
on a `governance_body` is a per-person operator action keyed to a Zitadel `sub`
— see `handoffs/martyrology.md` → "Grant a person a role on a body".

The Zitadel script prints handoff values per property at the end (issuer, org ID, project ID, app/client IDs, and — for confidential clients like CDCF — the **one-time client secret**). The OpenFGA script prints store ID + model ID. Use those values to write `handoffs/<property>.md` per the template in `handoffs/README.md`. **The CDCF client secret is unrecoverable** once the run finishes — capture it from the script output and store it in the consumer repo's deploy env at the moment of first provisioning.

## `--target local`: one env file per property

`--target production` and `--target staging` both name a single instance — the one on the VPS. **`--target local` does not.** Every umbrella property runs its own local Zitadel in its own compose stack, so "local" means a different instance depending on which property you are working on:

| Property | Local issuer | PAT location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cdcf-website` | `http://localhost:8090` | `cdcf-website/.zitadel-data/automation-user.pat` |
| `martyrology-api` | `http://localhost:8080` | `martyrology-api/.zitadel-data/automation-user.pat` |
| `martyrology-frontend` | own stack | `martyrology-frontend/.zitadel-data/automation-user.pat` |

So use one env file per property, and name it after the property:

```bash
ENV_FILE=.env.local.cdcf-website \
  ./setup-zitadel.sh --target local --create-orgs --provision-cdcf-website
```

`ENV_FILE` needs no code change — it has always overridden the `.env.$target` default. `.gitignore`'s `.env.*` already covers `.env.local.<property>`, so these files never land in git.

### Why not one shared `.env.local`

Because the failure is silent rather than loud. With a single `.env.local`, whichever property you configured last wins. Run `--provision-martyrology` while it still points at cdcf-website's instance and Martyrology's Project, roles and OIDC app are created **inside cdcf-website's local Zitadel** — and nothing errors. That PAT is a valid `IAM_OWNER` for the instance it belongs to, so every API call succeeds and the output looks completely normal. Both instances are "local", so there is no target name to tip you off either.

### The guard

`setup-zitadel.sh` refuses that combination rather than trusting the convention to be followed. Local stacks keep their PAT at `<property>/.zitadel-data/automation-user.pat`, so the script reads the owning property out of the PAT's own path and checks it against the stacks each action may legitimately target:

```text
[setup-zitadel] Target: local (issuer: http://localhost:8090, internal: http://127.0.0.1:8090)
[setup-zitadel] PAT file: /home/you/dev/cdcf-website/.zitadel-data/automation-user.pat
[setup-zitadel] Local property: cdcf-website
    ✗ --provision-martyrology provisions martyrology-api, but the resolved PAT belongs to cdcf-website.
    ⚠   Fix: ENV_FILE=.env.local.martyrology-api ./setup-zitadel.sh --target local --provision-martyrology
```

Exit code **17**, before anything is written.

It is an **allow-list per action, not one property per action**, because a stack may legitimately host another property's Project:

| Action | May run against |
| --- | --- |
| `--provision-cdcf-website` | `cdcf-website` |
| `--provision-martyrology` | `martyrology-api`, `martyrology-frontend` |
| `--provision-martyrology-frontend` | `martyrology-frontend` |

`martyrology-frontend/scripts/setup-stack.sh` runs `--provision-martyrology` against its **own** instance — the frontend authenticates there, so the Martyrology Project and roles have to exist in it. Pinning that action to `martyrology-api` alone would refuse a correct run. What stays refused is the cross-**family** case, which is the one actually reported: Martyrology provisioned while the PAT points at cdcf-website.

Three more details worth knowing:

- **Instance-wide actions are exempt.** `--create-orgs`, `--create-org` and `--rename-bootstrap-admin` act on the instance rather than a property, and `--create-orgs` is a prerequisite for provisioning a fresh local stack at all, so none of them are guarded.
- **LitCal skips on local, it does not refuse.** There is no LitCal local stack here — `--provision-litcal`, `--provision-litcal-frontend` and `--provision-litcal-tests-ui` all warn and exit 0, naming `LiturgicalCalendarAPI/scripts/setup-zitadel.sh`, which is what provisions LitCal locally. That keeps `--target local --all` sweeping, per the skip contract in `--help`.
- **`--target local --all` is refused**, because a sweep spans properties and no single PAT can be right for all of them. Provision one property at a time on local.

`ZITADEL_ALLOW_FOREIGN_PAT=1` overrides the check for a layout that keeps its PAT somewhere other than `<property>/.zitadel-data/`. The guard never applies to staging or production, where the target does identify the instance.

`setup-zitadel.selftest.sh` covers all of the above; run `./auth/setup-zitadel.selftest.sh` after touching any of it.

## Plesk-side setup

Two subdomains + two Plesk Docker Proxy Rules (one per subdomain). DNS + Let's Encrypt set up in the standard Plesk UI; routing is handled by Tools & Settings → Docker → Proxy Rules (NOT by "Additional nginx directives", which gets shadowed by Plesk's default `location /` going to Apache).

| Subdomain | Container | Container port | What's behind it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `auth.catholicdigitalcommons.org` | `cdcf-auth-zitadel-proxy-1` | 80 | Internal nginx that routes `/ui/v2/login*` → `zitadel-login:3000`, everything else → `zitadel:8080` |
| `authz.catholicdigitalcommons.org` | `cdcf-auth-openfga-1` | 8080 | OpenFGA HTTP API directly |

The `auth.*` rule points at the internal nginx proxy (`zitadel-proxy`) rather than directly at the Zitadel backend. The proxy handles the path-based split between the backend and the v2 login UI — Plesk's Docker Proxy Rules are per-subdomain, not per-path, so we keep path-level routing inside the compose stack where it's versioned with the rest of the config (`auth/nginx/zitadel.conf`).

## Backup

`backup/pg-dump.sh` uses the host's `pg_dump` directly (no `docker exec` needed since the DBs are on the host) and writes gzipped dumps to `/var/backups/cdcf-auth/`. Wire it into cron:

```cron
15 3 * * * /opt/cdcf-auth/auth/backup/pg-dump.sh >> /var/log/cdcf-auth-backup.log 2>&1
```

The Zitadel masterkey and `.env.production` are NOT in pg_dump output — back them up separately (e.g. via Plesk's backup tools, encrypted at rest).

## Recovery

Restoring Zitadel requires both the pg_dump AND the original `ZITADEL_MASTERKEY`. The masterkey decrypts secrets in the dump; without it the dump is unrecoverable. **This is the single most important secret to preserve out-of-band.**

## GitHub Actions sync workflow

`.github/workflows/sync-to-vps.yml` pulls the latest `main` into the on-VPS clone whenever `auth/**` changes (push to `main`) or when manually dispatched. Scope is intentionally narrow: **pull only** — no `docker compose up`, no script auto-runs. Compose-file changes still need a manual restart; role-catalog or setup-script changes still need a manual `--provision-*` invocation.

### One-time VPS provisioning

Run as root on the VPS:

```bash
sudo /opt/cdcf-auth/scripts/setup-vps-sync-user.sh
```

This creates a dedicated user (`cdcfinfra-deploy`) with no sudo and no shell access outside the repo dir, transfers ownership of `/opt/cdcf-auth` to that user, and restores `ubuntu:ubuntu` mode `0600` on `.env.production` so the secret stays unreadable to the sync user. The script prints the remaining one-time setup steps for SSH keypair generation, `authorized_keys`, repo secrets, and repo variables.

### Required GitHub repo settings

| Kind | Name | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Secret | `VPS_SSH_KEY` | PRIVATE half of the workflow's ed25519 keypair |
| Secret | `VPS_USERNAME` | `cdcfinfra-deploy` |
| Secret | `VPS_HOST` | hostname/IP of the VPS the runner SSHes to |
| Variable | `VPS_HOST_KEY` | output of `ssh-keyscan -t ed25519,rsa <host>` |
| Variable | `CDCF_INFRA_REPO_DIR` | `/opt/cdcf-auth` |

### Trust model

The dedicated user is the principle-of-least-privilege boundary. Even if `VPS_SSH_KEY` leaks, the blast radius is "can fast-forward git pull `/opt/cdcf-auth`" — not arbitrary code execution as the operator account. The `.env.production` secret stays owned by `ubuntu` mode `0600`, so the sync user cannot read it. The workflow uses `--ff-only` so any unexpected local commit on the VPS fails the pull loudly rather than silently merging.

## Adding a new consumer property

1. Decide whether the property gets its own Zitadel Org (per-property isolation, default) or fits under an existing Org.
2. Pre-provision the Org via `setup-zitadel.sh --target production --create-org <NAME>` if it doesn't exist.
3. Add provisioning logic to `setup-zitadel.sh` (a new `do_provision_<property>` function mirroring `do_provision_litcal`) that creates the Project + roles + OIDC app(s) the property needs. Roles + OIDC app config should be lifted from the property's own dev compose / config to ensure exact parity.
   - If the property runs a **local Zitadel stack**, add its action to the `action_properties` allow-list so the cross-provisioning guard covers it, and document its `.env.local.<property>` in [`--target local`](#--target-local-one-env-file-per-property) above. An action missing from that table is silently unguarded on local; list every stack the action may legitimately run against, not just the property it is named after.
4. For OpenFGA-using properties:
   - Drop the authorization model JSON into `auth/models/<StoreName>.json`.
   - If the model is inert without structural tuples (as `Martyrology` is), add them to `auth/models/<StoreName>.tuples.json` — an object with a `tuples` array of `{"user","relation","object"}` entries. Structural wiring only; never human role grants.
   - Run `./setup-openfga.sh --target production --create-store <StoreName>` to create the store, upload the model, and seed those tuples.
   - All properties share the single `openfga` database on the host Postgres, keyed by store name — no extra DB needed.
5. Write a handoff doc under `handoffs/<property>.md` with the non-secret values (issuer URL, client ID, project ID, store ID, model ID) the property's repo needs to consume. Secrets (client secret, preshared key) deliver out-of-band.
6. Open an issue in the property's repo with the handoff doc inline.
