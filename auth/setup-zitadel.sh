# setup-zitadel.sh — bootstrap and idempotent provisioning for cdcf-infra Zitadel.
#
# Reads credentials from .env.production (on the VPS) or .env.local (for
# pointing a dev-side script at a remote Zitadel). The automation PAT is
# loaded from the Zitadel data dir's automation-user.pat file written on
# first boot. Honors the --target {local,staging,production} convention from
# scripts/cdcf_api.py in the cdcf-website repo.
#
# Targets select which env file is sourced, and with it which Zitadel the
# script talks to. `staging` and `production` both resolve to the SAME
# production Zitadel: the staging frontends (litcal-staging.*,
# staging.catholicdigitalcommons.org) authenticate against it, which is why
# their origins are registered there. `local` is a separate Zitadel in its
# own compose stack. See issue #20 for why the URL-bearing actions do not
# yet vary their registered origins by target.
#
# Actions:
#   --create-orgs              Create the five umbrella Orgs idempotently.
#   --create-org NAME          Create a single Org by name (idempotent).
#   --provision-litcal         Under LiturgicalCalendar Org, create the
#                              LiturgicalCalendarAPI Project + roles +

#   --provision-litcal-frontend
#                              Under the same Project, create a Web/PKCE OIDC
#                              app for the frontend, with prod + staging
#                              callbacks registered. Requires --provision-litcal
#                              to have run (or be running together).
#   --provision-litcal-tests-ui
#                              Under the same Project, create a Web/PKCE OIDC
#                              app for the UnitTestInterface accuracy-test UI.
#                              Named -tests-ui, not -tests: the handoff notes
#                              reserve --provision-litcal-tests for a machine
#                              user (test service account), which is a different
#                              principal entirely. Requires --provision-litcal.
#   --provision-cdcf-website   Under the CDCF Org, create the "CDCF Website"

#                              "CDCF Website" for the production origin and
#                              "CDCF Website (Non-Prod)" for staging +
#                              localhost dev (devMode=true). Emits each
#                              client_secret ONCE on first run; re-runs against
#                              an existing app cannot recover the secret.
#   --provision-martyrology    Under the Martyrology Org, create the
#                              MartyrologyAPI Project + roles (admin,
#                              martyrology_editor, developer) + an API OIDC
#                              app with client_secret_basic (the API
#                              validates bearer tokens via Zitadel's

Targets:
  local       Separate local Zitadel (own compose stack), via .env.local
  staging     Production Zitadel, via .env.staging
  production  Production Zitadel, via .env.production

Actions:
  --create-orgs               Create CDCF, LiturgicalCalendar, BibleGet, OntoKit, Martyrology (idempotent)
  --create-org NAME           Create a single Org by name (idempotent)
  --provision-litcal          Provision LitCal Project + roles + API app
  --provision-litcal-frontend Provision LitCal Frontend OIDC app (Web/PKCE).
                              App AND origin follow --target: separate apps for
                              production and staging. Skips on local (that
                              instance is provisioned by the LitCal API repo).
  --provision-litcal-tests-ui Provision the UnitTestInterface OIDC app (Web/PKCE).
                              One app and one origin, so unlike the frontend it
                              is NOT target-scoped; skips on local.
  --provision-cdcf-website    Provision CDCF Website Project + roles + Web OIDC app (client_secret_post).
                              App AND origin follow --target: "CDCF Website" on
                              production, "CDCF Website (Non-Prod)" on staging,
                              localhost+devMode on local.
  --provision-martyrology     Provision Martyrology Project + roles + API app (client_secret_basic)
  --provision-martyrology-frontend
                              Provision Martyrology Frontend OIDC app (Web/client_secret_post).
                              Origin follows --target: localhost+devMode on local,
                              romanmartyrology.com on production. Skips on staging
                              (no Martyrology staging deployment yet).
  --rename-bootstrap-admin    Rename IAM admin user to \$ZITADEL_ADMIN_EMAIL
  --all                       Above eight in dependency order

Environment variables (sourced from .env.\$target):
  ZITADEL_ISSUER                 (default: https://auth.catholicdigitalcommons.org)
  ZITADEL_INTERNAL_URL           (default: http://127.0.0.1:8080)
  ZITADEL_PAT_FILE               (default: /opt/cdcf-auth/runtime/zitadel-data/automation-user.pat)
  ZITADEL_ADMIN_EMAIL            (used by --rename-bootstrap-admin)

Env file selection:
  ENV_FILE                       overrides the .env.\$target default above.
  ZITADEL_ALLOW_FOREIGN_PAT=1    disables the --target local property check.

  On --target local, use one env file PER PROPERTY:

      ENV_FILE=.env.local.cdcf-website ./setup-zitadel.sh --target local --provision-cdcf-website

  Every property runs its own local Zitadel, so "local" names a different
  instance per property. A single shared .env.local is last-writer-wins, and
  provisioning property A while it points at property B's instance SUCCEEDS
  silently — B's PAT is a valid IAM_OWNER there, so A's Project, roles and app
  land inside B with no error and normal-looking output. The script refuses
  that combination (exit 17) by reading the property out of the PAT's own path.

Targets and sweeps:
  A target provisions ONE app per property, not every app. So a full refresh is
  two sweeps, not one:

      ./setup-zitadel.sh --target production --all
      ./setup-zitadel.sh --target staging    --all

  An action with no origin defined for the given target skips with a warning
  and exits 0 — whether you named it explicitly or swept it with --all. That is
  deliberate: a non-zero exit would make --all unusable on any target where any
  one property lacks a deployment, which is true of staging today.

  ORDERING WARNING (LitCal): --target staging creates the new
  "LiturgicalCalendarFrontend (Staging)" app and emits a NEW client_id. Re-pin
  and deploy the staging frontend with it BEFORE running --target production,
  because that run is what drops the staging origin from the production app.
  Doing it the other way round breaks staging sign-in in the gap. Production
  sign-in is never at risk: the production app keeps its own client_id and
  origin throughout.

# --- issue #34: --target local cross-provisioning guard --------------------
#
# Every umbrella property runs its OWN local Zitadel, so "local" does not name
# one instance the way "production" does. With a single shared .env.local,
# whichever property was configured last wins — and provisioning property A
# while it points at property B's instance does not fail. That PAT is a valid
# IAM_OWNER for the instance it belongs to, so every API call succeeds, the
# output looks completely normal, and A's Project, roles and app quietly land
# inside B. Both are "local", so there is no target name to notice either.
#
# The convention that fixes it is ENV_FILE=.env.local.<property>. The guard
# below is what makes a violation loud instead of silent.

# Property that owns the resolved PAT, inferred from the PAT's own location:
# local stacks keep it at <property>/.zitadel-data/automation-user.pat. Empty
# when the path does not have that shape — which is itself a mismatch for any
# property-bound action, since a correctly-configured local run always does.

# touches both.
#
# --target local registers NOTHING on purpose. LitCal's local Zitadel is

# UnitTestInterface — the accuracy-test UI at litcal-tests, a sibling of the
# frontend under the same Project.
#
# Deliberately NOT target-scoped, unlike the frontend above. There is exactly one
# deployment of this UI and therefore one origin, so a production run and a staging
# run would send an identical redirectUris array. The reason the frontend needs
# separate apps per target — that UpdateApplication REPLACES the registered set, so
# one target's run would strip the other's callback — cannot arise where both runs
# write the same single value. Registering it under both targets means whichever
# target is run next converges this app, rather than it being covered by only one.
#
# `local` still registers nothing, for the same reason the frontend skips it: that
# instance is provisioned by LiturgicalCalendarAPI/scripts/setup-zitadel.sh, which
# creates its own app under the name "LiturgicalCalendar Tests".
#
# The name matches the app that already exists on the live instance, which is what
# makes this ADOPT it rather than create a second one beside it. That app was created
# by hand in the console and so carried Zitadel's defaults — an opaque access token and
# every assertion off — which left UTI unable to authenticate at all: its TokenValidator
# rejects a non-JWT structurally, falls back to the API's HS256-only /auth/me, and gets a
# 401. Running this action converges it to the same JWT + assertions the frontend has had
# all along.

# --- Martyrology Frontend (OIDC login client) -----------------------------
#
# A confidential Web app in the SAME MartyrologyAPI project as the API
# validator app. Same project means create_project's projectRoleAssertion puts
# urn:zitadel:iam:org:project:<id>:roles into the token with no :aud scope
# requested — which is why this is not a project of its own.
#
# One app per Zitadel INSTANCE, not two apps in one instance. The origin and
# devMode are chosen by --target because each target is a different instance:
#
#   --target local       localhost origin, devMode=true  -> LOCAL Zitadel
#                        (its own compose stack, mirroring LitCal's setup)
#   --target production  production origin, devMode=false -> production Zitadel
#
# So no localhost client is ever registered in the production instance — that
# is the spec's D3, and this is the mechanism that implements it rather than a
# departure from it. Because local and production are separate instances, both
# apps can share one name without colliding; create_oidc_web_app matches an
# existing app by name WITHIN a project, so nothing is overwritten across
# instances.
#
# Martyrology has no staging deployment yet (design doc: "Staging environment |
# None"). --target staging therefore registers nothing and skips with a
# warning. If a staging origin appears later it goes in the production Zitadel
# under a DISTINCT app name — staging and production share an instance, so a
# shared name there would overwrite the production app's redirect URIs.
