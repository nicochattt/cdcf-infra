# pg-dump.sh — daily backup for the cdcf-auth databases.
#
# Both databases live on the host's native PostgreSQL (the auth stack
# has no containerized DBs), so this uses the host's pg_dump directly.
# No docker exec needed.
#
# Dumps `zitadel` and `openfga` to gzipped files under
# /var/backups/cdcf-auth/, named with the UTC date, then copies them
# off-server over SFTP when SFTP_HOST is set.
#
# PEER_DBS names further databases to dump on the same host through the
# local `postgres` superuser role instead of a per-service password —
# `litcal_staging` and `litcal_production` in production. They are dumped
# this way because their credentials live in the API's own env file on a
# different vhost, and copying a second service's password into this one
# to read a database the local superuser can already reach would create a
# credential to rotate for no gain.
#
# Wire into cron:
#   15 3 * * * /opt/cdcf-auth/auth/backup/pg-dump.sh >> /var/log/cdcf-auth-backup.log 2>&1
#
# Reads connection credentials from /opt/cdcf-auth/auth/.env.production.
#
# IMPORTANT: this dump is NOT sufficient on its own. Zitadel decryption
# requires ZITADEL_MASTERKEY. Back it up separately, out-of-band.
#
# OFF-SERVER COPY. A dump that never leaves the machine does not survive
# the failure it exists for, so the push is part of this script rather
# than a caller's responsibility. It targets the same SFTP host Plesk's
# own backups use, but authenticates with its OWN key: Plesk's key lives
# under /opt/psa/var/modules/sftp-backup/ssh-keys/ with a randomly
# generated filename that the extension may regenerate on update, and a
# backup job that borrows it would start failing silently the day it did.
#
# Plesk's backups do NOT cover these databases and cannot be made to:
# Plesk backs up what is in its own registry, and every database there is
# MySQL. `zitadel` and `openfga` are host PostgreSQL databases it has no
# knowledge of. This script is the only thing backing them up.
#
# The push is SKIPPED, not failed, when SFTP_HOST is empty — so a local
# or staging run needs no credentials. When it IS set, a failed upload
# exits non-zero with the local dump left in place: losing the off-server
# copy silently is the one outcome worth making noisy.
