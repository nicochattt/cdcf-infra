# Catholic OS Umbrella — System Admin Handbook

End-to-end runbook for the shared Zitadel + OpenFGA infrastructure that serves the Catholic OS umbrella properties (cdcf-website, LiturgicalCalendar, BibleGet, OntoKit, Martyrology). Audience: anyone who needs to stand up, operate, debug, or hand off the umbrella auth stack.

This handbook lives in [`CatholicOS/cdcf-infra`](https://github.com/CatholicOS/cdcf-infra) and is the authoritative process document. Source-of-truth for individual concerns (compose definitions, env templates, setup scripts) lives in this same repo — this document orchestrates across them and adds the "why" that the code itself doesn't.

---

## 1. Overview

### What it is

A **single Zitadel instance** + **single OpenFGA instance** that all five Catholic OS umbrella properties consume as their identity provider and (where needed) relationship-based authorization layer.

| Service | Public URL | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Zitadel (backend + admin console) | `https://auth.catholicdigitalcommons.org` | OIDC issuer, IAM admin UI |
| Zitadel v2 login UI | `https://auth.catholicdigitalcommons.org/ui/v2/login` | The hosted login form the admin console redirects to. Each property's own user-facing login UI is built into that property's frontend (calling Zitadel APIs directly) — this UI is for admin console access. |
| OpenFGA HTTP API | `https://authz.catholicdigitalcommons.org` | Relationship-based authz checks + tuple writes |

(`cdcf` shortened for diagram width — the actual hostname is `catholicdigitalcommons.org`.)

### Why this architecture

Discussion: <https://github.com/CatholicOS/cdcf-website/discussions/98>. Summary: one Zitadel instance with one Zitadel **Org** per property gives shared infra (one runtime to upgrade, one DB to back up) with per-property admin/user isolation. Multi-instance was rejected — it's positioned for SaaS reseller scenarios, not for sibling properties of one umbrella.

### Component inventory

| Component | Image / version | Where defined |
|---|---|---|
| Zitadel backend | `ghcr.io/zitadel/zitadel:v4.15.0` | `auth/docker-compose.prod.yml` |
| Zitadel v2 login UI | `ghcr.io/zitadel/zitadel-login:v4.15.0` | same |
| Internal nginx proxy | `nginx:alpine` (config in `auth/nginx/zitadel.conf`) | same |
| OpenFGA | `openfga/openfga:v1.18.2` | same |
| OpenFGA migrate (one-shot) | `openfga/openfga:v1.18.2` | same |
| Authz model (LitCal) | `auth/models/LiturgicalCalendar.json` + `.lock.json` | owned here; synced from `LiturgicalCalendarAPI/scripts/openfga-model.json` on 2026-08-04 when ownership was centralized |
| Authz model (Martyrology) | `auth/models/Martyrology.json` + `auth/models/Martyrology.tuples.json` | this repo — the `.tuples.json` carries the structural `edition → governed_by → governance_body` wiring seeded at store creation |
| Setup script — Zitadel | `auth/setup-zitadel.sh` | this repo |
| Setup script — OpenFGA | `auth/setup-openfga.sh` | this repo |
| Backup script | `auth/backup/pg-dump.sh` | this repo |

Database for both Zitadel and OpenFGA is the **host's native PostgreSQL** (no containerized DB) — see [`auth/README.md`](../auth/README.md#prerequisites) for the full rationale and required setup.

## 2. Roles & responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|---|---|
| 👤 **System Admin** | First-time provisioning, secrets generation, Plesk UI work (subdomains, certs, Docker Proxy Rules, mailbox creation), Postgres role/db creation + `pg_hba.conf` edits + restart, env file editing on the VPS, day-2 ops (backups verification, upgrades, restoration drills). |
| 📜 **CLI scripts** in this repo | All Zitadel/OpenFGA API-driven provisioning: Org creation, Project/app/role provisioning, OpenFGA store creation + model upload, bootstrap-admin rename, IAM admin discovery. All idempotent — safe to re-run. |
| 🤖 **CI** (GitHub Actions, etc.) | Currently NONE in the umbrella infra repo. See §8 for the discussion of what could be CI-driven and the tradeoffs. Per-consumer property repos (LitCal API/Frontend, etc.) have their own CI pipelines that consume the umbrella's published values via env vars. |
| 👥 **Per-property maintainers** | Wire their own repos to the umbrella values via env vars; deploy their property's own stack pointing at the shared infra. Receive a handoff doc (see [`auth/handoffs/`](../auth/handoffs/)) with the non-secret IDs they need. |

Throughout the handbook each step is tagged with the icon for who/what performs it.

---

## 3. Prerequisites checklist

Before starting Phase 1, the system admin must have:

- [ ] 👤 Root or sudo access to the Plesk VPS hosting `catholicdigitalcommons.org`
- [ ] 👤 DNS control for the umbrella domain (to add `auth.*` and `authz.*` subdomains)
- [ ] 👤 Plesk admin UI access (to add subdomains, request Let's Encrypt, configure Docker Proxy Rules)
- [ ] 👤 Plesk **Docker extension** installed and functional
- [ ] 👤 Host **PostgreSQL 14+** running and reachable from `localhost` (verify with `psql --version` + `sudo -u postgres psql -tAc 'SELECT version();'`)
- [ ] 👤 Plesk mail service enabled for `catholicdigitalcommons.org` (Mailboxes can be created via Plesk UI or `plesk bin mail`)
- [ ] 👤 OpenDKIM signing already configured for `catholicdigitalcommons.org` (selector `mail`, key in `/etc/opendkim/keys/...`) — typically set up at the same time as the mail service
- [ ] 👤 SPF + DMARC TXT records published for `catholicdigitalcommons.org`
- [ ] 👤 A password manager / secrets vault for the small set of bootstrap secrets (`ZITADEL_MASTERKEY`, DB role passwords, the SMTP relay password, the OpenFGA preshared key) — **these never live in this repo**

---

## 4. Phase 1 — First-time umbrella provisioning

End state of this phase: `auth.catholicdigitalcommons.org` and `authz.catholicdigitalcommons.org` are live, the five umbrella Orgs exist in Zitadel, the IAM admin can sign in to the console, and SMTP is wired so Zitadel can send notifications.

### 4.1 DNS + Plesk subdomains [👤 Manual]

1. Add A/AAAA records for `auth.catholicdigitalcommons.org` and `authz.catholicdigitalcommons.org` pointing at the VPS public IP.
2. In Plesk, create both subdomains under the `catholicdigitalcommons.org` subscription. Enable Let's Encrypt (or whatever issuer Plesk uses by default).
3. Verify cert serves: `curl -I https://auth.catholicdigitalcommons.org` returns valid TLS.

### 4.2 Host Postgres prep [👤 Manual]

Run as the Postgres superuser. Strong passwords here are stored later in `.env.production` — generate them now and stash in your password manager:

```sql
CREATE ROLE zitadel WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '<gen-32-alphanum>';
ALTER ROLE zitadel CREATEDB;          -- Zitadel's start-from-init probes CREATEDB
                                       -- even when the DB already exists
CREATE DATABASE zitadel OWNER zitadel;

CREATE ROLE openfga WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '<gen-32-alphanum>';
CREATE DATABASE openfga OWNER openfga;
```

Edit `/etc/postgresql/<version>/main/pg_hba.conf` and append:

```
# Allow docker-bridge connections (cdcf-auth stack)
host  zitadel   zitadel  172.16.0.0/12  scram-sha-256
host  openfga   openfga  172.16.0.0/12  scram-sha-256
# Zitadel start-from-init connects to the postgres system DB first to verify
# its target DB exists; the zitadel role has no privileges in postgres DB
# by default, so this is a connect-only allow.
host  postgres  zitadel  172.16.0.0/12  scram-sha-256
```

Edit `/etc/postgresql/<version>/main/postgresql.conf`:

```
listen_addresses = '*'   # was 'localhost' — docker bridge needs *
```

Apply:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload postgresql    # picks up pg_hba changes (zero impact)
sudo systemctl restart postgresql   # picks up listen_addresses (~2-5s outage
                                    # affecting every DB on this Postgres —
                                    # schedule for low-traffic window)
```

The restart affects every Postgres client on the host. Plan it.

### 4.3 Clone cdcf-infra to canonical path [👤 Manual]

```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/CatholicOS/cdcf-infra.git /opt/cdcf-auth
sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /opt/cdcf-auth
sudo mkdir -p /opt/cdcf-auth/runtime/zitadel-data
sudo chmod 0777 /opt/cdcf-auth/runtime/zitadel-data    # scratch-image PAT constraint
```

### 4.4 Fill `.env.production` [👤 Manual]

```bash
cd /opt/cdcf-auth/auth
cp .env.production.example .env.production
chmod 0600 .env.production
# Edit and fill — generators in the file's comments
```

Required values to generate:

| Variable | How to generate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ZITADEL_MASTERKEY` | `openssl rand -base64 64 \| tr -d '/+=' \| head -c 32` (exactly 32 chars) | **Generated once. NEVER rotated** — encrypts secrets in the DB; loss = unrecoverable. Back up out-of-band. |
| `ZITADEL_DB_PASSWORD` | Same generator | Must match the password you set on the `zitadel` Postgres role in §4.2 |
| `OPENFGA_DB_PASSWORD` | Same generator | Must match the `openfga` role's password |
| `ZITADEL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `echo "$(openssl rand -base64 64 \| tr -d '/+=' \| head -c 16)Aa1!"` | Must satisfy Zitadel's complexity policy (upper + lower + digit + symbol). The `Aa1!` suffix guarantees all four classes. Force-changed on first login. |
| `ZITADEL_ADMIN_EMAIL` | Your email | The IAM admin's email — also becomes their login name (instance uses `UserLoginMustBeDomain=false` + `UserEmailAsUsername=true`). |
| `OPENFGA_PRESHARED_KEY` | `openssl rand -base64 48` | Bearer token consumed by every property that calls OpenFGA. |

SMTP values are filled later in §6.

### 4.5 Bring up the stack [👤 Manual]

```bash
cd /opt/cdcf-auth/auth
sudo docker compose --env-file .env.production -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Wait ~30s. Then verify:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/debug/ready    # → 200 (Zitadel via internal nginx)
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8081/healthz        # → 200 (OpenFGA)
ls /opt/cdcf-auth/runtime/zitadel-data/      # → automation-user.pat + login-client.pat
```

Both PATs land on first boot via the `FIRSTINSTANCE_*PATPATH` env vars in compose — if they're not there, see Troubleshooting §9.1.

### 4.6 Plesk Docker Proxy Rules [👤 Manual]

In Plesk → Tools & Settings → Docker → Proxy Rules → "Add Proxy Rule", create two entries:

| Domain | Container | Container port |
|---|---|---|
| `auth.catholicdigitalcommons.org` | `cdcf-auth-zitadel-proxy-1` | 80 |
| `authz.catholicdigitalcommons.org` | `cdcf-auth-openfga-1` | 8080 |

The auth-side rule **must point at the internal nginx proxy** (`cdcf-auth-zitadel-proxy-1`), not directly at `cdcf-auth-zitadel-1`. The internal nginx is what routes `/ui/v2/login*` to the login UI container vs everything else to the backend — Plesk's Docker Proxy Rules are per-subdomain, not per-path.

Verify:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://auth.catholicdigitalcommons.org/debug/ready    # → 200
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://authz.catholicdigitalcommons.org/healthz        # → 200
```

### 4.7 Rename bootstrap admin + create the Orgs [📜 CLI script]

```bash
cd /opt/cdcf-auth/auth
./setup-zitadel.sh --target production --all
```

`--all` runs seven actions in dependency order:

1. **`--rename-bootstrap-admin`** — Zitadel created the IAM admin with the legacy `<username>@<orgdomain>` suffix because the `DEFAULTINSTANCE_DOMAINPOLICY` env vars don't apply retroactively to users created inside the same `03_default_instance` migration. The script renames the admin to `${ZITADEL_ADMIN_EMAIL}` via `PATCH /v2/users/{id}` with `{"username":"...","human":{}}` — the empty `human` type discriminator is mandatory, see §10.2. Idempotent (a no-op once no user with the legacy suffix remains).
2. **`--create-orgs`** — creates the five umbrella Orgs: CDCF, LiturgicalCalendar, BibleGet, OntoKit, Martyrology. Idempotent (skips ones that already exist).
3. **`--provision-litcal`** — creates the LiturgicalCalendarAPI Project + 4 roles + API OIDC app (PRIVATE_KEY_JWT) under the LiturgicalCalendar Org. Idempotent. Prints handoff values at end.
4. **`--provision-litcal-frontend`** — the LitCal Frontend Web/PKCE app under that same Project. Detailed in §5.1.
5. **`--provision-cdcf-website`** — under the CDCF Org, the "CDCF Website" Project + the five WP-mirrored roles (`subscriber`, `contributor`, `author`, `editor`, `administrator` — `CDCF_ROLES` in the script; `team_member` was removed in Phase 5, the bio-edit ownership signal is the `author_team_member` ACF link, not a role) + **two** confidential Web apps (`client_secret_post`): `CDCF Website` for the production origin, and `CDCF Website (Non-Prod)` for staging + localhost dev with `devMode=true`. They are separate clients with separate secrets, so production credentials are never shared with staging.
6. **`--provision-martyrology`** — under the Martyrology Org, the MartyrologyAPI Project + roles (`admin`, `martyrology_editor`, `developer`) + an API app using `client_secret_basic` (the API validates bearer tokens through Zitadel's `/oauth/v2/introspect`, which is HTTP-Basic authenticated). The roles are a coarse population gate on curation writes; OpenFGA remains the authority on every per-resource decision.
7. **`--provision-martyrology-frontend`** — the Martyrology Frontend Web app (`client_secret_post`) in that same Project. Its origin follows `--target`: `localhost:3000` + devMode on `local`, `romanmartyrology.com` on `production`. **Skipped on `staging`** — Martyrology has no staging deployment yet.

⚠ Actions 5, 6 and 7 create **confidential** apps, and their `client_secret` is printed exactly **once**, in the output of the run that creates them. Zitadel's `ListApplications` never returns secrets, so a re-run cannot recover one — the only remedy is regenerating the secret in the console. Capture them into the consuming property's env file during the run itself; see [`auth/handoffs/martyrology.md`](../auth/handoffs/martyrology.md) and [`auth/handoffs/cdcf-website.md`](../auth/handoffs/cdcf-website.md).

Individual actions can also be run on their own — that's the normal path once the umbrella is up and only one property needs (re)provisioning. Run `./setup-zitadel.sh --help` for the full action list.

After successful run, you can sign in to the admin console at `https://auth.catholicdigitalcommons.org/ui/console/` using `ZITADEL_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ZITADEL_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. First login forces a password change.

### 4.8 OpenFGA stores + models [📜 CLI script]

```bash
./setup-openfga.sh --target production --create-litcal-store
./setup-openfga.sh --target production --create-martyrology-store
```

Each action creates the store (idempotent) and uploads `auth/models/<StoreName>.json` as the authorization model (idempotent — re-uploads only if the file diverges from what's already in the store). Prints the store ID + model ID.

Each store also has `auth/models/<Store>.lock.json` (`store_name`, `store_id`, `model_id` — nothing else), recording the model ID this repo last uploaded there. The script only reads this file; it never writes it — the JSON to commit is printed on stderr instead, since the provisioner has no way to write into the VPS's `auth/models/` (owned by the sync user, not the `ubuntu` account the provisioner runs as) and shouldn't dirty the tracked checkout `sync-to-vps.yml` pulls with `--ff-only` anyway. The guard reads the lock's `store_id` first, and behaves differently in each of the three situations it can be in:

| Lock file | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| present, `store_id` = **this** store | If the store's latest model is not the recorded one, someone uploaded outside this repo: the run **refuses** (exit 7, printing both IDs and the lock JSON to commit once the file has been re-synced) rather than replacing their model. This check runs **before** the file-vs-store comparison, so a stale lock refuses even when the model file is byte-identical to what's deployed. `--force-model-upload` overrides — use it only when replacing the deployed model is what you actually intend. If the lock is merely stale (the model file already matches the store's latest model), `--force-model-upload` uploads nothing in that case — it just reports the correct lock to commit, so it's also the way to re-adopt a stale-but-matching lock. |
| present, `store_id` = **another** store | Not applicable to this environment (e.g. the committed production lock, when provisioning a local dev stack): the guard is **bypassed completely** — no refusal, no lock update reported — and the run does the plain compare-and-upload. Without this, every consumer's local `authz-seed` would break the moment the model changed. |
| absent | The store is unknown to this repo, so it is never overwritten blind: a file identical to the store's latest **adopts** the lock (no refusal; the lock JSON to commit is printed), a file that differs **refuses** (exit 7) unless `--force-model-upload` is passed. |

An HTTP error from OpenFGA is never a verdict: a failed store listing or model read aborts the run (exit 9) instead of being read as "no such store" / "no model yet".

Where an `auth/models/<StoreName>.tuples.json` file exists it is also seeded — currently only Martyrology has one, carrying the structural `edition → governed_by → governance_body` tuples the model is useless without. Only tuples missing from the store are written; tuples present in the store but absent from the file are reported as drift and left alone (the script never deletes). Human role grants (`user:<sub>` → reader/editor/admin) are **not** seeded — they are per-person operator actions, see [`auth/handoffs/martyrology.md`](../auth/handoffs/martyrology.md).

`--create-store NAME` handles any other store by model-file basename; `--seed-tuples NAME` re-seeds tuples after editing a tuples file, without touching the model.

### 4.9 Write the handoff docs [👤 Manual]

Capture the IDs printed by §4.7 and §4.8 into the per-property handoff docs — [`auth/handoffs/liturgicalcalendar.md`](../auth/handoffs/liturgicalcalendar.md), [`auth/handoffs/cdcf-website.md`](../auth/handoffs/cdcf-website.md), [`auth/handoffs/martyrology.md`](../auth/handoffs/martyrology.md). The template + secret-handling conventions are in [`auth/handoffs/README.md`](../auth/handoffs/README.md). PR + merge the populated handoffs into `main`.

Note that a handoff may deliberately keep its `<populated on first run>` placeholders rather than carry the real IDs in-repo (cdcf-website does) — in that case the canonical filled-in values live in the provisioning log on the VPS, not here. Either way, **no secrets in these files.**

---

## 5. Phase 2 — Per-property wiring (LitCal as the canonical example)

End state: a consumer property is live, authenticating users via the shared Zitadel and authorizing via shared OpenFGA. Each subsequent property follows the same pattern.

LitCal has two consuming repos: `LiturgicalCalendarAPI` (backend) and `LiturgicalCalendarFrontend`.

### 5.1 Frontend OIDC app [📜 CLI script]

```bash
./setup-zitadel.sh --target production --provision-litcal-frontend
```

Creates a Web/PKCE OIDC app (`auth_method_type=NONE`) named `LiturgicalCalendarFrontend` under the existing LiturgicalCalendarAPI Project, with prod + staging callback URIs (`https://litcal{,-staging}.johnromanodorazio.com/auth/callback.php`) and post-logout URIs registered.

The Frontend app's `client_id` is DISTINCT from the API Backend's. See §9.7 for the cross-wire bug class.

### 5.2 Hand off the values [👤 Manual]

Open an issue in the consumer repo with the handoff doc inline. Example: <https://github.com/Liturgical-Calendar/LiturgicalCalendarAPI/issues/597>. Deliver the secrets (`OPENFGA_PRESHARED_KEY`, any service-user PATs) out-of-band — encrypted message, password-manager share, never in the issue.

### 5.3 Consumer-side env (their responsibility, document for them) [👥 Property maintainer]

LitCal example, split across the two repos:

**LiturgicalCalendarAPI** `.env.production` / `.env.staging`:
```
ZITADEL_ISSUER=https://auth.catholicdigitalcommons.org
ZITADEL_PROJECT_ID=<from handoff>
ZITADEL_CLIENT_ID=<API Backend client_id from handoff>
# ZITADEL_MACHINE_TOKEN=<optional, if making outbound Management API calls>

OPENFGA_API_URL=https://authz.catholicdigitalcommons.org
OPENFGA_STORE_ID=<from handoff>
OPENFGA_MODEL_ID=<from handoff>
OPENFGA_PRESHARED_KEY=<out-of-band>
```

**LiturgicalCalendarFrontend** `.env.production` / `.env.staging`:
```
ZITADEL_ISSUER=https://auth.catholicdigitalcommons.org
ZITADEL_CLIENT_ID=<Frontend client_id from handoff — DIFFERENT from the API one>
FRONTEND_URL=https://litcal{,-staging}.johnromanodorazio.com
```

The Frontend gets NO `OPENFGA_*` vars and NO `ZITADEL_MACHINE_TOKEN` — it doesn't talk to OpenFGA directly and only ever holds user tokens.

### 5.4 Per-property state — verified against production 2026-08-04

A snapshot, not a source of truth: the per-property handoffs in [`auth/handoffs/`](../auth/handoffs/) own the IDs, and this table exists so an operator can see at a glance what is actually provisioned before running anything. Every row was read back from the live Zitadel and OpenFGA APIs on the date above.

**Running OpenFGA version: `v1.18.2`**, in production since 2026-08-04 10:53Z. Verified 2026-08-05 from the container itself, not from a file — `docker inspect cdcf-auth-openfga-1` reports `Config.Image=openfga/openfga:v1.18.2`, and the server's own startup log reports `build.version: v1.18.2` (`build.commit: 560d5d3d`). It was upgraded by pulling the image in the Plesk Docker interface and recreating the container; `auth/docker-compose.prod.yml` was only corrected to match afterwards (PR #28), so between those two events the compose file described a version that was not running. See the drift note in §10.3.

| Org | Zitadel Project | Project roles | OpenFGA store |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CDCF` | `CDCF Website` (`376050623310725125`) | `subscriber`, `contributor`, `author`, `editor`, `administrator` | none — by design, see [`handoffs/cdcf-website.md`](../auth/handoffs/cdcf-website.md) |
| `LiturgicalCalendar` | `LiturgicalCalendarAPI` (`373246750732845059`) | `admin`, `developer`, `calendar_editor`, `test_editor` | `LiturgicalCalendar` (`01KRSCF4GVX0X4ZNXXJQEC4XXJ`) |
| `Martyrology` | `MartyrologyAPI` (`384518610174869507`) | `admin`, `martyrology_editor`, `developer` | `Martyrology` (`01KZ1M9NJR1JHTMTV091X5DMYZ`) |
| `BibleGet` | none — pre-provisioned Org stub | — | none |
| `OntoKit` | none — pre-provisioned Org stub | — | none |

**Martyrology OpenFGA rollout (the Task-6 `platform` / `on_platform` model) is live.** Full detail and the verification queries live in [`handoffs/martyrology.md`](../auth/handoffs/martyrology.md) → "Rollout status"; in summary:

- Latest authorization model is `01KZ3VZC7RAAX7TEMMVAYEBPW8` (types `user`, `platform`, `governance_body`, `edition`), superseding the pre-Task-6 `01KZ1M9NM7YRM5PB1KH2WF67XX`, which remains in the store's model history.
- `MARTYROLOGY_OPENFGA_MODEL_ID` in `/etc/martyrology/api.env` is pinned to that model. **The pin is what makes it take effect** — the API checks against a fixed model, never "latest", so an upload alone changes nothing.
- All 11 structural tuples are seeded (8 `governed_by` + 3 `on_platform`), and the one-time `superuser` bootstrap tuple on `platform:martyrology` exists. No direct `reader`/`editor`/`admin` tuple exists on any governance body — platform superuser inheritance is currently the only grant path in the store.

⚠ When reading tuples back, a `tuple_key` filtered by `relation` alone is rejected by OpenFGA (`validation_error: … the object type field is required`), and piping that error through `jq '.tuples | length'` prints a misleading `0`. Pin a `user` alongside the object type — worked examples are in the Martyrology handoff's "Verify" section.

## 6. SMTP configuration

End state: Zitadel can send emails (init codes, password reset, email verification) via Plesk's local Postfix.

### 6.1 Create the relay mailbox [👤 Manual]

```bash
NEWPASS="$(openssl rand -base64 64 | tr -d '/+=' | head -c 28)"
sudo plesk bin mail --create noreply@catholicdigitalcommons.org \
    -mailbox true -passwd "$NEWPASS" \
    -manage-virusfilter true -manage-spamfilter true -mbox_quota 100M
# Save NEWPASS into your secrets vault — needed for the env file below.
```

### 6.2 Stash creds in `.env.production` [👤 Manual]

Append (or update) the SMTP block:

```bash
SMTP_HOST=catholicdigitalcommons.org    # NOT host.docker.internal — see §9.4
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=noreply@catholicdigitalcommons.org
SMTP_PASSWORD=<from above>
SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@catholicdigitalcommons.org
SMTP_FROM_NAME="Catholic Digital Commons Foundation"     # quote — has spaces
```

### 6.3 Register the SMTP provider with Zitadel [👤 Manual, via API]

There's no script for this yet (it's a one-time bootstrap). Use the automation PAT:

```bash
cd /opt/cdcf-auth/auth
set -a; source .env.production; set +a
PAT=$(cat /opt/cdcf-auth/runtime/zitadel-data/automation-user.pat)

ADD_RESULT=$(curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin/v1/email/smtp \
    -H "Host: auth.catholicdigitalcommons.org" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $PAT" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "$(jq -n --arg sender "$SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS" --arg name "$SMTP_FROM_NAME" \
                --arg host "$SMTP_HOST:$SMTP_PORT" --arg user "$SMTP_USER" --arg password "$SMTP_PASSWORD" \
        '{tls: true, senderAddress: $sender, senderName: $name, host: $host, user: $user, password: $password, description: "Plesk Postfix relay"}')")
SMTP_ID=$(echo "$ADD_RESULT" | jq -r '.id')

# Activate the provider
curl -sS -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin/v1/smtp/$SMTP_ID/_activate" \
    -H "Host: auth.catholicdigitalcommons.org" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $PAT" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'

# Send a test
curl -sS -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin/v1/smtp/$SMTP_ID/_test" \
    -H "Host: auth.catholicdigitalcommons.org" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $PAT" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"receiverAddress\":\"$ZITADEL_ADMIN_EMAIL\"}"
# Check inbox; check mail log for the outbound DKIM-signed delivery.
```

This procedure is a candidate for promotion to a CLI script (e.g. `auth/setup-smtp.sh`) when we have a second umbrella SMTP scenario to validate against.

### Key constraints / gotchas

- Zitadel SMTP is **instance-wide**, not per-org. All umbrella properties get the same sender. Per-org **email body templates** are still customizable via the management API if/when property-branded copy is wanted.
- `SMTP_HOST` MUST be the public hostname (`catholicdigitalcommons.org`), not `host.docker.internal`. Plesk presents the proper Let's Encrypt cert via SNI on the public hostname; the loopback connection presents the self-signed Plesk cert and Zitadel's TLS verification fails. The container reaches the public IP via NAT loopback.
- DKIM signing happens transparently via OpenDKIM milter on outbound mail. The selector is `mail` (not the default `default` or Plesk's `plesk`).

## 7. Day-2 operations

### 7.1 Backups [👤 Manual setup, 🤖 cron-automated thereafter]

The script `auth/backup/pg-dump.sh` produces gzipped pg_dump output of the auth DBs (`zitadel`, `openfga`) plus everything named in `PEER_DBS` — `litcal_staging` and `litcal_production` in production — and prunes anything older than 14 days. Wire into cron:

```cron
15 3 * * * /opt/cdcf-auth/auth/backup/pg-dump.sh >> /var/log/cdcf-auth-backup.log 2>&1
```

**Run it detached when running it by hand.** A multi-GB dump outlives a flaky SSH
session, and a disconnect takes the script with it:

```bash
sudo setsid nohup /opt/cdcf-auth/auth/backup/pg-dump.sh > /tmp/bk-run.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```

Cron is unaffected — it never had a terminal to lose. Dumps are written to a `.part`
name and renamed only when complete, so an interrupted run leaves no file that could
be mistaken for a good backup; the partial is removed on exit, and anything a SIGKILL
left behind is swept by the next run.

Dumps land in `/var/backups/cdcf-auth/` and are then copied off-server over SFTP, to the same host Plesk's own backups use (`SFTP_*` in `.env.production`). The push is part of the script rather than a follow-on step: a dump that never leaves the machine does not survive the failure it exists for.

**Plesk's backups do NOT cover these databases, and cannot be made to.** Plesk backs up what is in its own registry, and every database there is MySQL; `zitadel` and `openfga` are host PostgreSQL databases it has no knowledge of. This script is the only thing backing them up. The same was true of `litcal_staging` and `litcal_production` until they were added to `PEER_DBS`; `bibleget_dev` and the `marriage_booklet_*` set are still uncovered.

The job authenticates with its own key (`/root/.ssh/cdcf-backup`), not Plesk's. Plesk's key lives under `/opt/psa/var/modules/sftp-backup/ssh-keys/` with a randomly generated filename the extension may regenerate on update; a job that borrowed it would start failing the day it did.

Failure behaviour is deliberate: a failed or incomplete upload exits non-zero and leaves the local dumps in place, and the retention prune never runs after one — a run that could not get its dump off the box must not also delete the older ones that did. Success is confirmed against a remote directory listing rather than sftp's own exit code, since `put` can report success for a transfer the far end truncated.

Set `SFTP_HOST=` (empty) to disable the push and keep dumps local only, which is the right setting anywhere but production.

`zitadel` and `openfga` are dumped with the passwords in `.env.production`. The `PEER_DBS` databases are dumped through the local `postgres` superuser instead: their credentials live in the API's own env file on a different vhost, and copying a second service's password in here — to reach a database the local superuser already can — would only create another credential to rotate. A `PEER_DBS` name that does not exist is a hard error, checked before anything is written, so a typo cannot leave a half-finished run.

Large databases (`LARGE_DBS`) are handled differently from the rest: dumped at `LARGE_GZIP_LEVEL` under `nice`/`ionice`, and **deleted locally once the off-server copy is confirmed**. `/var/backups` cannot hold a 14-day window of multi-GB dumps, and `gzip -9` over several GB is heavy enough to disturb the host — measured on `bibleget_dev` (4.7 GB), it was enough to drop an SSH session. The remote keeps their history; a restore of one fetches from there.

**Host configuration** (`CONFIG_PATHS`) is archived alongside the dumps and is **always age-encrypted**; the script refuses to run if `AGE_RECIPIENT` is unset. This is not ceremony: `ZITADEL_MASTERKEY` lives in `/opt/cdcf-auth/auth/.env.production`, and the `zitadel` dump it decrypts is going to the same destination. Encrypting to a key whose private half never touches the server is what keeps that co-location from undoing the "back the masterkey up separately" rule.

Plesk **does** back up the vhost env files — verified by extracting an actual backup archive, which contains `httpdocs/LiturgicalCalendar/.env.production` and `api/dev/.env.staging`. `CONFIG_PATHS` is only for what Plesk cannot reach: `/opt`, `/etc`, and the service PATs under `runtime/zitadel-data/`.

To inspect the config archive without writing anything — worth doing periodically to
confirm the offline key still decrypts it, which is the only part of this backup no
automated check can prove:

```bash
set -o pipefail
age -d -i cdcf-backup.key config-<ts>.tar.gz.age | tar -tz
```

`pipefail` is load-bearing here, not boilerplate. Without it the pipeline reports
`tar`'s status, and `tar` can list what it managed to read and exit 0 while `age`
failed — so a truncated or undecryptable archive would look like a passing check,
which is the one thing this command exists to rule out.

`tar -t` lists and extracts nothing. Members are stored as absolute paths, so tar
reports `Removing leading '/' from member names` — expected, and what makes the
staged restore below land in the right place.

To restore, extract to a STAGING directory and copy back deliberately:

```bash
set -o pipefail
staging=$(mktemp -d)          # fresh, mode 700, not a predictable name
age -d -i cdcf-backup.key config-<ts>.tar.gz.age | tar -xz -C "$staging"
# then inspect, and copy only what you meant to restore, e.g.
#   cp "$staging/opt/cdcf-auth/auth/.env.production" /opt/cdcf-auth/auth/
rm -rf "$staging"             # it held the masterkey in cleartext
```

`mktemp -d` rather than a fixed `/tmp/cfg-restore`: this archive expands to
`ZITADEL_MASTERKEY` and both service PATs in cleartext, and a predictable path in a
world-writable directory can be pre-created by another local user, who would then own
the directory the secrets land in. The staging copy is deleted afterwards for the same
reason.

Do **not** pipe straight into `tar -xz -C /`. That overwrites live configuration in
place with whatever the archive holds — including a `.env.production` whose
`OPENFGA_MODEL_ID` and other pins may be older than what is deployed, which would
silently roll the running system back to the state of the backup.

**Critical**: the `ZITADEL_MASTERKEY` is NOT in pg_dump. Without it, the dump is mathematically unrecoverable (secrets in events are encrypted). Back up the masterkey separately, out-of-band, in your password manager.

### 7.2 Restoration drill [👤 Manual, run periodically]

To verify backups actually work — recommended at least quarterly:

1. Provision a throwaway VPS or VM with the same Postgres version.
2. Restore the latest `zitadel-*.sql.gz` and `openfga-*.sql.gz` dumps.
3. Bring up the compose stack with the SAME `ZITADEL_MASTERKEY`.
4. Confirm `curl /debug/ready` returns 200 and a known user can log in to the admin console.
5. Tear down.

If step 4 fails, the masterkey backup is wrong/missing OR the dump is corrupted — diagnose before you actually need to restore.

### 7.3 Upgrades [👤 Manual]

1. Pin a new image tag in `auth/docker-compose.prod.yml` (e.g. `ghcr.io/zitadel/zitadel:v4.13.0`). Open a PR for the version bump.
2. Read the upstream changelog for the bump range — Zitadel occasionally has manual migration steps.
3. Take a backup IMMEDIATELY before the upgrade (`./backup/pg-dump.sh`).
4. Merge PR, pull on VPS, `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`. Zitadel migrations run automatically on first start of the new version.
5. Verify `/debug/ready` returns 200 and re-test admin console login.
6. If it breaks, roll back: pin the previous tag, `docker compose up -d`, restore DB if migrations were destructive.

Login UI (`zitadel-login`) and OpenFGA upgrade the same way. Version-pin the login UI to match the backend; mixing versions is unsupported.

### 7.4 Monitoring [👤 Manual setup]

The umbrella infra doesn't currently have a monitoring story baked in. Recommendations:

- **Liveness**: external uptime check on `/debug/ready` for both subdomains (UptimeRobot, Statuscake, etc.)
- **Mail**: parse `/var/log/maillog` for rejection patterns or set up a periodic test send + receipt check
- **Disk**: alert on `/var/backups/cdcf-auth/` not changing day-over-day (no recent backup = silent failure)
- **Postgres**: standard Postgres monitoring covers both Zitadel + OpenFGA since they share the host instance

## 8. GitHub Actions vs manual: env-handling strategy

The question: could GitHub Actions hold the umbrella's env values and push them to `.env.staging` / `.env.production` on the VPS automatically?

**Short answer: partially, and only after first provisioning is done. The hybrid is more sensible than going all-in either direction.**

### What CAN flow from GH Actions to server `.env`

| Value | Source of truth | Auto-publish to GH secrets? |
|---|---|---|
| `ZITADEL_ISSUER` | Stable infrastructure constant | ✓ yes (it's not even secret — could be a `vars`, not a `secrets`) |
| `OPENFGA_API_URL` | Same | ✓ yes |
| `ZITADEL_PROJECT_ID` (per property) | Generated by `setup-zitadel.sh --provision-litcal` | ⚠ Yes BUT only after Phase 2 has run — operator manually puts the ID into the GH secret after generation. |
| `ZITADEL_CLIENT_ID` (per OIDC app) | Same | ⚠ Same as above |
| `OPENFGA_STORE_ID`, `OPENFGA_MODEL_ID` | Generated by `setup-openfga.sh --create-litcal-store` | ⚠ Same |
| Static config (image versions, hostnames) | This repo's compose file | ✓ Already source-controlled — no need to mirror in GH secrets |

### What probably should NOT flow through GH Actions

| Value | Why not |
|---|---|
| `ZITADEL_MASTERKEY` | Single most catastrophic-if-leaked secret; generated once and never rotated. Don't put it in any system that's not strictly need-to-know. |
| Per-property `OPENFGA_PRESHARED_KEY` | Currently shared across consumers. Future direction may split per-consumer; keep delivery out-of-band until that's decided. |
| `ZITADEL_DB_PASSWORD`, `OPENFGA_DB_PASSWORD` | Tied to Postgres role passwords; if you rotate via CI, you need atomic ALTER ROLE + .env update + container restart, which is hard to do safely. |
| `ZITADEL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Bootstrap only — force-changed on first login. Pointless to keep in CI after that. |
| SMTP relay password | Tied to the Plesk mailbox; rotating means coordinated Plesk + Zitadel API update. |

### Recommended hybrid

1. **Source-control non-secret config** in this repo (already done): image versions, public hostnames, port mappings, env templates, compose file.
2. **Manual generation + manual `.env` placement on the VPS** for the small set of high-stakes secrets (masterkey, DB passwords, SMTP password, preshared key). They live exactly one place: the VPS `.env.production`, backed up to a password manager. No CI involvement.
3. **GH Actions secrets for generated-then-stable IDs** (Project ID, Client ID, Store ID, Model ID) once Phase 1 + Phase 2 have produced them. The CI in each consumer property's repo can then read these as env at deploy time, eliminating manual env edits per-consumer.

### The bootstrap circular problem

You can't put generated IDs in GH secrets before you've generated them. So Phase 1 is ALWAYS manual on the VPS. Once Phase 1 + Phase 2 emit the handoff IDs, you can promote them to GH secrets for future re-deploys of consumer repos. Setting up CI for the umbrella infra repo itself (cdcf-infra) is low-value — there's nothing here to "deploy" beyond the compose file + scripts that the operator already runs by hand.

### Concrete suggestion

- Leave the umbrella infra repo (`cdcf-infra`) CI-free for now. Operator runs scripts by hand from the VPS.
- For each consumer property repo, after Phase 2 emits its handoff values, the property's maintainer adds the non-secret IDs to their repo's GH Actions secrets (e.g. `ZITADEL_PROJECT_ID`, `ZITADEL_CLIENT_ID`, `OPENFGA_STORE_ID`, `OPENFGA_MODEL_ID`). Their existing deploy workflow templates them into the `.env.production` it ships.
- Truly-secret values (preshared key, machine-token PATs, JWT_SECRET) stay as GH Actions secrets too if the property's CI deploys them; the umbrella operator delivers them once via secure channel.

## 9. Troubleshooting catalog

Each entry: error message → root cause → fix. Drawn from real incidents during the umbrella's initial rollout.

### 9.1 Bootstrap PAT files don't appear in `runtime/zitadel-data/`

**Symptom**: `ls /opt/cdcf-auth/runtime/zitadel-data/` returns empty after first `docker compose up`; Zitadel logs show the bootstrap PAT printed to stdout as a bare random-looking string.

**Cause**: `ZITADEL_FIRSTINSTANCE_PATPATH` and/or `ZITADEL_FIRSTINSTANCE_LOGINCLIENTPATPATH` not set in compose — Zitadel falls back to printing the PAT to stdout.

**Fix**: verify both env vars are set in `auth/docker-compose.prod.yml` under the `zitadel` service. They were added in PR #3; pull main if you're on an older checkout.

### 9.2 Zitadel container crash-looping with "permission denied to create database"

**Cause**: `zitadel` Postgres role doesn't have `CREATEDB`. Zitadel's `start-from-init` probes by attempting CREATE DATABASE even when the target DB exists.

**Fix**: `sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER ROLE zitadel CREATEDB;"`, then `docker compose restart zitadel`.

### 9.3 Zitadel container crash-looping with `no pg_hba.conf entry for host ... user "zitadel", database "postgres"`

**Cause**: Zitadel's `start-from-init` connects to the `postgres` system DB BEFORE connecting to its target. The pg_hba.conf rule covering `database=zitadel` doesn't cover the system DB connect.

**Fix**: add the third pg_hba.conf rule per §4.2 (`host postgres zitadel ...`), reload Postgres.

### 9.4 Zitadel SMTP test fails with TLS cert verification error

**Cause**: Set `SMTP_HOST` to `host.docker.internal`. The Postfix loopback presents the self-signed `CN=Plesk` cert; Zitadel's TLS verification rejects it.

**Fix**: change `SMTP_HOST` to `catholicdigitalcommons.org` (the public hostname). Plesk serves the proper Let's Encrypt cert via SNI on the public name. Container resolves via public DNS and reaches the VPS via NAT loopback.

### 9.5 Admin console redirects to `/ui/v2/login/login?authRequest=...` and shows `{"code": 5, "message": "Not Found"}`

**Cause**: `zitadel-login` (v2 UI) container not running, OR Plesk Docker Proxy Rule for `auth.*` points directly at `cdcf-auth-zitadel-1` instead of the internal nginx proxy `cdcf-auth-zitadel-proxy-1`.

**Fix**: verify `docker compose ps` shows `cdcf-auth-zitadel-login-1` as up. Verify Plesk Docker Proxy Rule for `auth.catholicdigitalcommons.org` targets `cdcf-auth-zitadel-proxy-1` (port 80), not the Zitadel backend directly.

### 9.6 Bootstrap admin login name has weird `@<orgdomain>` suffix

**Cause**: Even with `DEFAULTINSTANCE_DOMAINPOLICY_USERLOGINMUSTBEDOMAIN=false` set in compose, the domain policy doesn't apply retroactively to the bootstrap user created inside the same `03_default_instance` migration.

**Fix**: `./setup-zitadel.sh --target production --rename-bootstrap-admin` (renames to `${ZITADEL_ADMIN_EMAIL}` via `PATCH /v2/users/{id}` with body `{"username":"...","human":{}}`). The `"human":{}` empty type discriminator is REQUIRED — without it the API returns `501 "user type is not implemented"`, which is a misleading error meaning "missing type discriminator", not a real implementation gap.

### 9.7 Property's frontend login fails after env "just" being set

**Class of symptoms**:
- `/auth/login.php` → 503 `{"error":"OIDC not configured"}` — `ZITADEL_ISSUER` or `ZITADEL_CLIENT_ID` missing/empty.
- `/auth/login.php` → 500 `{"error":"Failed to initialize OIDC client"}` — `FRONTEND_URL` missing (separate var, not checked by `isConfigured()`; throws inside `fromEnv()`).
- Redirects to Zitadel but registration creates user in WRONG ORG (the ZITADEL default org, not LiturgicalCalendar) — Frontend's authorize URL doesn't include the Zitadel-specific org-scope `urn:zitadel:iam:org:id:{orgId}`.
- Login form rejects credentials — `ZITADEL_CLIENT_ID` cross-wired (used the API Backend's `PRIVATE_KEY_JWT` client_id where the Frontend's Web/PKCE client_id should be).

**Common diagnostic** for the env-missing ones: PHP's catch in `auth/login.php` hides the actual exception message but logs it. `sudo tail /var/log/apache2/error.log` (or equivalent) shows the real cause.

### 9.8 Admin console shows `[permission_denied] Organisation doesn't exist (AUTH-Bs7Ds)` then works after refresh

**Cause**: Initial-load race in Zitadel v4 — multiple parallel API calls fire immediately after token issue; some hit the org-context resolver before some cache primes. Identical calls a few hundred ms later succeed.

**Fix**: none needed — benign. The error popup goes away after a page refresh and the underlying state is sound. Consider opening an upstream issue if it ever blocks real work.

### 9.9 `.env.<environment>` file edited but values don't take effect (LitCal Frontend specific)

**Cause**: `Dotenv\Dotenv::createImmutable` with multi-file array means **first-match-wins**. If `.env.local` exists with `KEY=` unset, it shadows `.env.production` where the value is set. Also, `.env.staging` was missing from the loader list until LiturgicalCalendarFrontend PR #308 — older deployments may not have the fix.

**Fix**: ensure target env file is HIGHER priority in the loader list than any shadowing file. Order is `.env.local → .env.development → .env.staging → .env.production → .env`.

### 9.10 New user registered via v2 login UI signup but no email verification sent

**Cause**: The Zitadel v2 login UI (Next.js — `ghcr.io/zitadel/zitadel-login`) calls `AddHumanUser` on signup. **By default it omits the `email.verification.send_code` field** on that call, so Zitadel creates the user in `USER_STATE_ACTIVE` with email unverified — and queues no notification at all (even with SMTP healthy and the new user being a passkey signup).

The chain just never starts; Postfix won't show any outbound attempt because Zitadel never asked it to send.

**Fix**: set `EMAIL_VERIFICATION=true` as an env var on the `zitadel-login` service. This is a Next.js env var consumed by the login UI itself — NOT a Zitadel backend setting and NOT in the Zitadel docs as a backend-side toggle. When set, the UI populates the verification block on `AddHumanUser`; Zitadel then queues the verification email at signup time.

```yaml
# auth/docker-compose.prod.yml — zitadel-login service env
EMAIL_VERIFICATION: 'true'
```

**Diagnosis hint**: if SMTP `/admin/v1/smtp/_test` works and Postfix logs show the test delivery (DKIM signed, SPF pass), but real signups produce no outbound attempts in the mail log, this env var is the differentiator. Compare against a working dev compose where the same UI flow does send emails.

**Side-effect fix already on disk**: this gotcha was hit on the umbrella's staging deploy; the env var is now in `auth/docker-compose.prod.yml` and applied live. If you wipe + rebootstrap and the var isn't there for some reason, this section is the marker for the regression.

**Alternative manual recovery for an existing wrong-state user**: trigger verification on the affected user explicitly via management API: `POST /management/v1/users/{id}/email/_resendinitialization` (or equivalent v2 endpoint). Useful for users that signed up BEFORE the env var was set.

## 10. Appendix

### 10.1 Env var reference (umbrella `.env.production`)

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ZITADEL_MASTERKEY` | ✓ | 32-char encryption key. **Never rotate.** Loss = unrecoverable DB. |
| `ZITADEL_DB_NAME`, `ZITADEL_DB_USER`, `ZITADEL_DB_PASSWORD` | ✓ | Host Postgres role for Zitadel |
| `OPENFGA_DB_NAME`, `OPENFGA_DB_USER`, `OPENFGA_DB_PASSWORD` | ✓ | Host Postgres role for OpenFGA |
| `ZITADEL_ADMIN_USER`, `ZITADEL_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ZITADEL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | ✓ | IAM admin bootstrap. Login name = email. |
| `ZITADEL_ADMIN_FIRSTNAME`, `ZITADEL_ADMIN_LASTNAME` | optional | Display name (default: "IAM Admin") |
| `OPENFGA_PRESHARED_KEY` | ✓ | Bearer token for OpenFGA HTTP API |
| `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS`, `SMTP_FROM_NAME` | required for §6 | Plesk Postfix relay creds (reference values; Zitadel stores its own internally) |

### 10.2 Useful API endpoints (Zitadel admin/management)

All require automation PAT in `Authorization: Bearer ...` + `Host: auth.catholicdigitalcommons.org` header.

| Action | Method + path |
|---|---|
| List Orgs | `POST /zitadel.org.v2.OrganizationService/ListOrganizations` |
| Create Org | `POST /zitadel.org.v2.OrganizationService/AddOrganization` (NOT `CreateOrganization` — Zitadel inconsistency) |
| List Projects (in org) | `POST /zitadel.project.v2.ProjectService/ListProjects` |
| Create Project | `POST /zitadel.project.v2.ProjectService/CreateProject` |
| Update Project | `POST /zitadel.project.v2.ProjectService/UpdateProject` — body uses `projectId`, NOT `id` |
| Add Role | `POST /zitadel.project.v2.ProjectService/AddProjectRole` |
| Create App (API or OIDC) | `POST /zitadel.application.v2.ApplicationService/CreateApplication` |
| Rename user | `PATCH /v2/users/{id}` with `{"username":"...","human":{}}` for human users or `{"username":"...","machine":{}}` for machine users. The empty type-discriminator wrapper is required even when only `username` changes. This is what `setup-zitadel.sh --rename-bootstrap-admin` calls (§4.7, §9.6) — it has no fallback path. The legacy `PUT /management/v1/users/{id}/username` with `{"userName":"..."}` still works if you need it for a manual one-off. |
| Update user profile (display name, etc.) | `PATCH /v2/users/{id}` with `{"human":{"profile":{...}}}` |
| Add SMTP provider | `POST /admin/v1/email/smtp` |
| Activate SMTP provider | `POST /admin/v1/smtp/{id}/_activate` |
| Test SMTP send | `POST /admin/v1/smtp/{id}/_test` |

### 10.3 Gotchas list (one-liners)

- **`docker-compose.prod.yml` is not authoritative for what is running.** Plesk's Docker extension can pull a new image and recreate a container from its UI without touching the compose file in git, and nothing reconciles the two. This is not hypothetical: production OpenFGA was moved from `v1.15.1` to `v1.18.2` that way on 2026-08-04, and the compose file still said `v1.15.1` for a day afterwards — long enough that a plan was written to "upgrade" a service that was already upgraded. Before trusting a pin, check the container: `docker inspect <name> --format '{{.Config.Image}}'`, and confirm against the service's own startup log (`docker logs <name> | grep build.version`), since the image *tag* can be re-pointed while the container keeps running an older layer.
- Zitadel v2 verb inconsistency: `AddOrganization` but `CreateProject` + `CreateApplication`. `UpdateProject` body uses `projectId`, not `id`.
- Zitadel v2 `PATCH /v2/users/{id}` requires a `human: {}` or `machine: {}` type discriminator in the body — even for top-level field updates like `username`. Without it the API returns `501 "user type is not implemented"`, which sounds like a real gap but is actually a missing-discriminator error. See §10.2 for the correct body shape.
- `DEFAULTINSTANCE_DOMAINPOLICY_*` env vars apply to USERS CREATED AFTER bootstrap, not retroactively to the bootstrap admin itself.
- `ZITADEL_MASTERKEY` must be exactly 32 chars.
- `ZITADEL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` must satisfy default complexity policy (upper + lower + digit + symbol). Alphanumeric-only crashes the `03_default_instance` migration.
- The `zitadel` Postgres role needs `CREATEDB`.
- pg_hba.conf needs THREE rules for Zitadel: `zitadel`-on-`zitadel`, `openfga`-on-`openfga`, AND `zitadel`-on-`postgres` (for the bootstrap DB-existence probe).
- `host.docker.internal` is reachable from containers via the docker bridge gateway, but Postfix's self-signed cert on that hostname fails Zitadel's TLS verification. Use the public hostname for SMTP.
- Per-org SMTP is not natively supported. One instance-wide sender; per-org email body templates are still customizable.
- DKIM selector for catholicdigitalcommons.org is `mail` (not `default` or `plesk`).
- File-load order on multi-file Dotenv loaders is first-match-wins; `.env.local` shadows everything.
- Passkey registration doesn't trigger email verification automatically.
- Property frontends must include the Zitadel org-scope on the authorize URL or registrations land in the IAM default org.
- API Backend's `client_id` and Frontend's `client_id` are DIFFERENT and must not be cross-wired.
- The Liturgical-Calendar GitHub org uses `development` as default branch (not `main`). Always target `development` for PRs there.
